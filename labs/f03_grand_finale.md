# Three Lives and a Scoreboard

## Overview

In this grand finale for our game you will do the following:

- Add a seven segment display to keep score
- Add logic for a successful target hit:
  - Make your buzzer buzz a happy buzz
  - Add one point to the hit counter (make sure it updates on your seven segment display)
  - Increase the step of the pwm running in the thread to speed up your shark to make each level harder to beat
- Add logic for a missed laser fire:
  - Make your buzzer buzz a sad buzz
  - Darken one of the three LEDs (you start with 3 lives)
- Add logic for once you run out of lives to buzz a fun little buzz indicating the game has ended.


## What to do

Here is the wiring diagram for the last stage of the game.  The new additions are the black buzzer in the bottom right corner of the breadboard and the 7 segment display on the far left of the diagram.  Those are the only 2 new things you need to wire up.  In the picture below, you will see the photoresistor has moved just to make the picture smaller, but the wiring for it has not changed.

The Buzzer's positive side connects to GP9 on the Pico (column 12 on the bottom) and then the negative side to ground.  The 7 segment display connects to GP0 and GP1 (column 1 and 2 on the bottom) and also connects to the 5V positive rail and ground.

Once you have the pico wired and the game stage set as seen above, take some time to attempt to code the points outlined in the overview using the old labs, building on our code from the Sharks With Laser Beams lab.

Helpful hint: Set a baseline photores value to determine if a hit happened or not from the laser (in the code solution provided below I used a 20% variance between an initial photores reading and the reading pulled in during a laser attempt)

If you got all of this to work, then go for a new high score!  and then another!  and then another!  and then another!
