# Photo Resistors

## Overview

From the previous lab on resistors, you should understand how resistors play a valuable role in electronics by limiting or resisting the flow of electricity which we could see in our LED dimming.  The resistors we used to this point provided a fixed amount of resistence, therefore, each resistor has had a specific Ohms rating.  However, now in this lab we will work with a type of variable resistor... the Photoresistor

## Photresistor

A Photoresistor(pictured below) is a type of variable resistor that provides some level of resistance that varies as the amount of light shining on it varies.  That is as more light shines on the photoresistor, the less resistence it provides.  So, in a dark environment the photoresistor will provide more resistence than when light is shining on it.

 ## What to do

For this lab, we will simply replace the resistor in our circuit with our photoresistor.  So simple remove the resistor that connects the long side of the LED currently in column 30 to the power rail. Now add the photoresistor in place of it.  Connect one side of the photoresistor leg to Column 30 and the other side to the positive power rail.  The legs of the photoresistor can go either way.

Once you have the photo resistor in place, try covering the photoresistor with your finger and see if the light dims.  Then remove your finger from the top of the photoresistor and see if the LED brightens.  

Now you have a variable resistor in place!  We can use variable resistors in the future as analog input devices.  That is they are not digital where they provide a binary value, but analog in the fact they can provide a range of values that vary.  Don't worry too much about this for now, but just have fun playing with your photoresistor... for fun shine a bright light(light from your phone) on the photoresistor and see if you can get your LED really bright.  

If it works let out a quiet "Oh Yeah!".
